With its privacy, there is no way anyone can trace a transaction back to you. With it's adaptability, we hope to bring AmityCoin on everyday devices. This means it can easily be adapted to everyday life - for example, paying for your weekly shop or even topping your phone up. Whilst being ASIC resistant, meaning you can't take over the network with a machine built to mine, every coin is equally fair to mine even when using your CPU power, however little that may be. AmityCoin hopes to bring a coin that will always remain user friendly and welcoming others to join."
